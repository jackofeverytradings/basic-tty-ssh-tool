                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate

پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو

نسخه‌ی 3، هشتم تیرماه یک‌هزار و سیصد و هشتاد و شش شمسی

 

هرکسی مجاز به نسخه‌برداری و توزیع کلمه‌ به کلمه‌ی این پروانه می‌باشد ولی تغییر دادن آن مجاز نیست.

 

دیباچه

 

پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو یک مجوز سهوتالیف (Copyleft) برای نرم‌افزار و انواع دیگر محصولات است.

 

پروانه‌ی استفاده از اکثر نرم‌افزارها یا محصولات کاربردی مختلف به‌گونه‌ای طراحی شده‌اند تا آزادی شما را در تغییر یا به اشتراک گذاردن آن محصول از شما بگیرند، در عوض هدفِ اصلیِ پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو تضمین آزادی شما در به‌اشتراک گذاشتن و تغییر تمام نسخه‌های یک نرم‌افزار است؛ برای حصول اطمینان از اینکه نرم‌افزار برای همه کاربرانش آزاد باقی می‌ماند. ما -بنیاد نرم‌افزارهای آزاد- برای اکثر نرم‌افزارهای خودمان از پروانه جامع همگانی گنو استفاده می‌کنیم؛ این پروانه شامل تمام محصولاتی که مولفین آنها کار خود را مشمول آن بدانند نیز می‌شود؛ شما هم می‌توانید برنامه‌های خود را به همین روش مشمول این پروانه کنید.

 

وقتی ما از نرم‌افزار آزاد صحبت می‌کنیم به مفهوم آزادی اشاره می‌کنیم و نه به قیمت. پروانه‌های جامع همگانی ما برای حصول اطمینان از اینکه شما آزادی توزیع نسخه‌هایی از نرم‌افزارهای آزاد را دارید (و آزادید برای عمل توزیع مبلغی دریافت کنید) طراحی شده‌اند، برای اطمینان از اینکه شما حتماً کد منبع نرم‌افزار را دریافت می‌کنید و یا در صورتی که به آن نیاز داشتید امکان دریافت آن را خواهید داشت،  اینکه شما بتوانید در نرم‌افزار تغییرات مورد نظر خود را بدهید یا قسمتهایی از آن را در نرم‌افزارهای آزاد جدید استفاده کنید و اینکه آگاه باشید که آزادید که همه این کارها را انجام بدهید.

 

برای حفاظت از حقوقِ شما، ما باید دیگران را از امکان سلب این حقوق از شما و یا امکان درخواست برای کوتاه‌آمدن از این حقوق منع کنیم؛ در نتیجه در صورتی که نسخه‌هایی از نرم‌افزار را توزیع می‌کنید یا تغییراتی در آن ایجاد می‌کنید مسوولیتهای مشخصی در قبال این کارها دارید. مسوولیتهایی به منظور به رسمیت شمردن آزادی دیگران.

 

به عنوان نمونه، اگر شما نسخه‌هایی از چنین نرم‌افزاری را توزیع می‌کنید، چه به رایگان چه در قبال دریافت مبلغی، شما موظفید آزادی‌هایی که دریافت کرده‌اید را نیز انتقال دهید. شما باید اطمینان حاصل کنید که گیرنده هم کد منبع را دریافت نموده و یا امکان دریافت آن را دارد و شما باید این قوانین را به آنها نشان دهید تا از حقوق خود آگاه باشند.

 

آن دسته از برنامه‌نویسها و تهیه‌کنندگان نرم‌افزار که پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو را به کار می‌گیرند در دو مرحله حقوق شما را حفظ می‌کنند: (1) آزاد کردن نرم‌افزار از بند قوانین حق‌التالیف و (2) ارایه این پروانه به شما و درنتیجه واگذار کردن قانونی حقوق نسخه‌برداری، توزیع و یا تغییر نرم‌افزار به شما.

 

واضح است برای حفاظت حقوق مولفین، تهیه‌کنندگان و برنامه‌نویسان، پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو تاکید می‌نماید که هیچ تضمینی برای استفاده از این نرم‌افزار آزاد وجود ندارد. برای حفظ حقوق کاربران و مولفین پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی نشانه‌گذاری نسخه‌های تغییر یافته با نسخه اولیه‌ را الزامی می‌داند تا به اشتباه مشکلات آنها از طرف مولفین نسخه‌های قبلی پنداشته نشود.

 

بعضی دستگاه‌ها و تجهیزات به گونه‌ای طراحی شده‌اند تا دسترسی کاربران برای نصب و یا اجرای نسخه‌ی تغییر یافته‌ی نرم‌افزار درونیشان را محدود سازند، با اینکه تولیدکنندگان این تجهیزات امکان انجام این کار را دارند این راه‌کار از اساس و ریشه با هدف حفاظت از آزادی کاربران در تغییر نرم‌افزار در تضاد است. به طور معمول قالب سازمان‌یافته‌ی این سو استفاده در حیطه‌ی تولید محصولاتی است که که برای استفاده‌ی خاص کاربران تولید می‌شوند و این‌جا دقیقاً همان جایی است که سو استفاده از حقوق کاربر بی‌نهایت ناپسند است؛ بنابراین ما نگارشِ حاضر از پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی را طراحی کردیم تا جلوی این سو استفاده در محصولات ذکر شده را بگیریم. اگر مشکلات مشابهی در حیطه‌های دیگری نیز بروز کند ما آماده خواهیم بود آنچنان که شایسته‌ی حفظ آزادی کاربران است با گسترش قوانین مرتبط در نگارشهایِ آتیِ پروانه‌یِ جامعِ  همگانی گنو در مقابل آنها ایستادگی کنیم.

 

در نهایت، هر نرم‌افزار به صورت روزمره در خطر مشکلات ثبت قانونی ایده‌ها و کدهای نرم‌افزاری می‌باشد. کشورها نباید اجازه ثبت مواردی که توسعه و استفاده از نرم‌افزارها را روی رایانه‌های چند منظوره محدود می‌کنند صادر نمایند ولی برای آن دسته از کشورهایی که چنین می‌کنند ما امیدواریم با جلوگیری از غیرآزاد شدن نرم‌افزار از پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو تحت هر شرایطی از خطر استفاده از ایده‌های ثبت شده برای تغییر یک نرم‌افزار از آزاد به یک نرم‌افزار اختصاصی پیشگیری کنیم.

 

در زیر جزییات دقیق اصول و قوانین نسخه‌برداری، توزیع و تغییر می‌آید:

 

شرایط و مقررات

0. تعاریف

«این پروانه» به نسخه‌ی سوم پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو اشاره می‌کند.

 

«حق تالیف» شامل قوانین مشابه قانون حق‌تالیف که برای محصولات دیگری استفاده می‌شود نیز می‌گردد، نمونه‌ی این محصولات طرح نیمه‌رساناها می‌باشد.

 

«نرم‌افزار» به هر کار یا محصولی که بتوان قانون حق‌تالیف را در مورد آن پیاده نمود و مشمول این پروانه نیز باشد اطلاق می‌گردد. از هر پروانه‌دار در این متن با «شما» یاد شده است و منظور از «گیرندگان» یا «دریافت‌کنندگان» می‌تواند اشخاص و یا سازمانها باشد.

 

«تغییر» یک کار به معنی نسخه‌برداری تمام و یا قسمتی از یک کار به نحوی است که نیاز به مجوز صاحب آن کار باشد و نسخه‌برداری عینی شامل تغییر نمی‌شود. نتیجه‌ی این عمل «کارِ تغییر یافته» نامیده می‌شود که تغییر یافته‌ی کارِ قبلی و یا کاری «بر اساس» کارِ قبلی است.

 

«کارِ تکمیلی» به مفهوم نرم‌افزار تغییر نیافته و یا کاری بر اساسِ نرم‌افزارِ به‌کار برده شده است.

 

«تکثیر» یک کار به معنی انجام هرکاری به غیر از اجرای یک نرم‌افزار روی یک رایانه یا تغییر یک نسخه‌ی شخصی از نرم‌افزار است که است که به طور مستقیم یا غیر مستقیم شما را مسوول رعایت قوانین حق‌تالیف مرتبط با آن نرم‌افزار بنماید.  تکثیر شامل نسخه‌برداری، توزیع (با تغییر یا بدون تغییر)، ارایه به عموم و در بعضی کشورها موارد دیگری نیز می‌شود.

 

«رساندن» یک کار به معنی هر گونه تکثیر است که به دیگران امکان ایجاد و دریافت نسخه‌هایی از کار را بدهد. ارتباط محض با کاربری دیگر تحت شبکه، بدون انتقال یک نسخه از کار رساندن محسوب نمی‌شود.

 

یک رابط کاربر فعال «اعلانات قانونی مقتضی» را به گونه‌ای واضح و قابل درک نمایش می‌دهد به‌گونه‌ای که به حتم (1) پیغام حق‌تالیف مناسب را نمایش دهد و (2) به طور واضح برای کاربر مشخص نماید که هیچ تضمینی برای کار (به غیر از ضمانت‌های قید شده) وجود ندارد، که پروانه‌هایی که کار بنابر آن پروانه‌ها مشمول آنهاست و شیوه‌ی نمایش یک نسخه از پروانه را مشخص سازد. اگر رابط کاربر امکان استفاده از دستورات و یا یک منو را در اختیار کاربر می‌گذارد یکی از دستورات یا گزینه‌های اصلی می‌بایست با شرایط ذکر شده سازگار باشد.

 

1. کد منبع

 

فرم «کدِ منبع» یک کار به معنی فرم ارجح یک کار برای ایجاد تغییرات در آن کار می‌باشد. فرم «کد مقصد» یک کار به معنی هر فرمی از کار است که «کد منبع» نباشد.

 

«رابطِ استاندارد» به معنی رابطی است که یا به‌صورت رسمی توسط موسسات استاندارد ثبت گردیده و یا در صورتی که رابطی است که برای کار با یک زبان برنامه‌نویسی خاص طراحی شده است یک رابطِ شناخته شده بین برنامه‌نویسان آن زبان برنامه‌نویسی می‌باشد.

 

«کتابخانه‌های سیستمیِ» یک کار قابل اجرا شامل هر چیزی، به جز خود کار به عنوان یک کل، می‌باشد که (الف) در حالت عادی بسته‌بندی یک واحد بزرگ  (Major Component)لحاظ گردد ولی جزیی از آن واحد بزرگ نباشد و (ب) خدمت و فعالیتش فقط برای استفاده‌ی آن واحد بزرگ باشد و یا برای پیاده‌سازی یک استاندارد باشد که بصورت کد منبع در اختیار عموم قرار دارد.

یک «واحد بزرگ» در این متن به معنی یک واحد اولیه مهم (برای مثال هسته‌ی نرم‌افزاری، سیستم پنجره‌سازی و امثال آنها) برای یک سیستم عامل خاص می‌باشد (در صورت وجود چنین سیستمی) که کار قابل اجرا در نهایت روی آن اجرا می‌شود و یا نرم‌افزار مترجمی که برای تهیه نسخه‌ی اجرایی کار استفاده شده است و یا یک کد مقصد که یک نرم‌افزار مفسر آن را اجرا می‌کند.

 

«کد مرتبط» برای یک کار در فرم کد مقصد به تمام کدهای منبعی گفته می‌شود که برای تولید، نصب و (برای یک کار قابل اجرا) اجرای آن کد مقصد به کار رفته باشد و برای تغییرِ کار استفاده گردد. اسکریپتهایی که برای کنترل این فعالیتها استفاده می‌شوند نیز در همین دسته می‌گنجند اما کتابخانه‌های سیستمی و یا ابزارهای چندکاره‌ و یا نرم‌افزارهای آزادی که بدون تغییر برای کار استفاده شده‌اند به عنوان کد مرتبط کار شناخته نمی‌شوند.

به عنوان نمونه، کد مرتبط شامل فایلهای تعریف رابط با کدهایِ منبع برای کار و کدهایِ منبعِ کتابخانه‌های استاندارد و نرم‌افزارهای به اشتراک گذاشته‌شده‌یِ پویا که کار به طور خاص به گونه‌ای طراحی شده که به آنها نیاز دارد، برنامه‌هایی مثل کدهای انتقال داده و یا کنترل جریان داده‌ها بین زیربرنامه‌ها و یا قسمتهای مختلف کار می‌شود.

 

کد مرتبط شامل قسمتهایی که کاربران می‌توانند بصورت خودکار از دیگر قسمتهای کد مرتبط تولید کنند نمی‌شود.

کد مرتبط برای یک کار در فرم کد منبع، کد منبع همان کار می‌باشد.

 

2. اختیارات ابتدایی

 

تمام حقوق اعطا شده بنا بر این مجوز به عنوان حق‌تالیف نرم‌افزار اعطا شده‌اند و در صورتی که شرایط توضیح داده‌شده حفظ گردند غیر قابل ابطال می‌باشند. این پروانه به طور مشخص تاکید بر حق نامحدود شما برای اجرای برنامه‌ی تغییر نیافته دارد. خروجی یک کار تحت این پروانه فقط در صورتی تحت این پروانه خواهد بود که محتوای آن شامل کاری باشد که آن نیز تحت پروانه باشد. این پروانه حقوق شما برای استفاده عادی یا مشابه آن به گونه‌ای که در قانون حق‌تالیف  به آن اشاره شده است به رسمیت می‌شناسد.

 

تا وقتی که پروانه‌ی شما به نحوی شما را باز دارد می‌توانید کارهای مشمول این پروانه را برای اجرا بسازید، اجرا نمایید و یا بدون رساندن تکثیر نمایید. به شرطی که قوانین این پروانه به طور کامل رعایت شود شما می‌توانید کار شامل این پروانه را  با اینکه شما صاحب پروانه‌ی آن نیستید تکثیر نموده و در اختیار دیگران قرار دهید تا تغییراتی را مختص شما روی برنامه انجام دهند و یا امکاناتی برای اجرای آن در اختیار شما قرار بدهند. اشخاصی که کار شامل پروانه را برای شما اجرا می‌کنند باید به طور خاص کار را به وکالت شما، تحت کنترل شما و با نظارت شما انجام دهند به نحوی که امکان نسخه‌برداری از کاری که در اختیار شما قرار دارد را جز برای رابطه‌ی کاری شما نداشته باشند.

 

تکثیر تحت هر شرایط دیگری فقط بنا به ضوابط و قوانینی مجاز است که در زیر به آنها اشاره شده است. صدور پروانه‌هایی جزیی(Sublicensing)  مجاز نیست و بند 10 این متن نیز آنها غیرلازم می‌سازد.

 

3. حفاظت از حقوق کاربران در برابر قانون ضد قفل شکنی (Anti-Circumvention)

 

هیچ‌یک از کارهای مشمول این پروانه نمی‌بایست بر اساس هر یک از قوانین ضد قفل شکنی که در بند 11 قانون حق‌التالیف WIPO که در تاریخ 29 آذرماه 1376 تصویب شده است یا قوانین مشابه جلوگیری از شکستن قفلهای تعبیه شده برای حفاظت از حقوق مولفین به عنوان یک فن‌آوری شکستن این قفلها شناخته شود.

 

وقتی شما کاری را که مشمول این پروانه می‌شود «می‌رسانید» مجازید تا جایی که بر اساس این پروانه قفل شکنی محسوب نمی‌شود به فعالیت خود ادامه دهید و از تمامی حقوق مرتبط با کار که ممکن است بنابر قوانین شما را مجبور به قفل گذاری آن کار شود بگذرید و از گونه حقی که موجب محدودیت کاربران در زمینه تغییر کار یا اجبار کاربر، شما یا ذینفعهای ثالث کار به معنی اجبار برای شکستن قفل گردد بگذرید.

 

4. رساندن نسخه‌های حرف به حرف

 

شما مجازید نسخه‌های حرف به حرف و تغییر نیافته کد منبع را نرم‌افزار را همانطور که دریافت کرده‌اید رو هر رسانه‌ای به دست دیگران برسانید به شرطی که به طور آشکار و دقیق روی هر نسخه اعلان مربوط به پروانه را منتشر کنید و تمام اعلانهای مربوط به این پروانه و تمام بندهای مجازی که مطابق با بخش 7 این پروانه بر کد تعریف شده‌اند و اعلانهای وجود نداشتن ضمانت  را حفظ کرده و به تمام دریافت کنندگان یک نسخه از این پروانه را بدهید.

 

شما مجازید هر مبلغی که دوست دارید و یا هیچ هزینه‌ای بابت هر نسخه‌ای که به کاربر می‌رسانید دریافت کنید و می‌توانید بابت ضمانت کردن کار و یا خدمات پشتیبانی هزینه‌ای دریافت نمایید.

 

5. رساندن نسخه‌های تغییر یافته کد منبع

 

شما مجازید کاری تغییر یافته را که بر اساس کار اولیه می‌باشد یا تغییراتی برای تهیه از روی برنامه را به فرم کد منبع بر اساس قوانین بخش 4 به دیگران برسانید به شرطی که تمام شرایط زیر را رعایت نمایید:

 

الف) کار باید حاوی اعلانهای واضحی باشد که مشخص نماید شما آن را تغییر داده‌اید و تغییرات باید دارای تاریخ معتبری باشند.

 

ب) کار باید شامل اعلانهای مشخصی باشد که نشان دهند کار تحت این پروانه و شرایط اضافی مطابق با بند 7 این پروانه قرار دارد. این دستور‌العمل، دستورالعمل بخش 4 مبتنی بر «تغییر ندادن هیچیک از اعلانها» را تعویض می‌کند.

 

ج) شما باید کل کار را، به عنوان یک کار کامل، برای هر کسی که ممکنم است نسخه‌ی تغییر یافته را دریافت کند مشمول این پروانه کنید. بدیهی است تمام بندهای مُجازی که طبق بخش 7 این پروانه به کل کار افزوده شده باشند برای تمام کار و بدون توجه به شیوه ارایه و بسته‌بندی کار معتبر می‌باشد. این پروانه اجازه نمی‌دهد که کار تحت هیچ پروانه‌ی دیگری ارایه شود ولی در صورتی که شما کار را با چنین پروانه‌هایی دریافت کرده‌اید موجب ابطال آنها نمی‌شود.

 

د) در صورتی که کار شمال رابط کاربر فعال می‌باشد، هر یک از رابطهای کاربر می‌بایست اعلانهای حق‌تالیف مرتبط را نمایش دهند ولی اگر برنامه رابطهای کاربری دارد که اعلانهای حق‌تالیف را نمایش نمی‌دهند شما ملزم به پیاده‌سازی این قابلیت نخواهید بود.

 

مجموعه‌ای شامل کار تغییر یافته که به صورت جداگانه و به همراه کارهای مجزای دیگر ارایه می‌شود که به طور اصولی رابطه‌ای با کار ندارند  و به گونه‌ای ترکیب نشده‌اند که یک برنامه‌ی بزرگ‌تر را بسازند، بر روی یک رسانه‌ی ذخیره‌سازی یا توزیع یک «ترکیب» نامیده می‌شود به شرطی که مجموعه‌ی قوانین حق‌تالیف حاصل از ترکیب به‌گونه‌ای نباشد که دسترسی یا حقوق قانونی کاربران ترکیب را فراتر از آنچه تک تک کارهای موجود در ترکیب بصورت جداگانه ارایه می‌کنند محدود نماید. افزودن کاری تحت پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو به یک ترکیب موجب مشمول شدن دیگر کارهای ترکیب به این پروانه نمی‌گردد.

 

6. رساندن نسخه‌هایی به غیر از کد منبع

 

شما مجازید یک کار مشمول این پروانه را به صورت کد مقصد به دیگران برسانید به شرطی که این عمل مطابق بخش‌های 4 و 5 این پروانه باشد و در ضمن کد منبع قابل خوانده شدن توسط ماشین را طبق قوانین این پروانه و به یکی از سه روش زیر ارایه کنید:

 

الف) کد مقصد را روی یک محصول فیزیکی (شامل رسانه‌ی فیزیکیِ توزیع) به همراه کد منبع روی یک رسانه‌‌ی قابل اطمینان که به طور خاص برای جابجایی نرم‌افزارهای رایانه‌ای استفاده می‌شود برسانید.

 

ب) کد مقصد را روی یک محصول فیزیکی (شامل رسانه‌ی فیزیکیِ توزیع) به همراه یک پیشنهاد کتبی که حداقل برای سه سال معتبر باشد و بسته به کاربری محصول تحت عنوان ارایه خدمات پشتیبانی یا قطعات یدکی بسته به هرکسی که کد مقصد را داراست ارایه می‌شود (1) یک نسخه از کد منبع مرتبط را برای تمام نرم‌افزارهای آن محصول که با این پروانه ارایه می‌شوند روی یک رسانه قابل اطمیان که به طور خاص برای جابجایی نرم‌افزارهای رایانه‌ای استفاده می‌شود  در ازای دریافت مبلغی که بیشتر از هزینه‌ی متداول رساندن فیزیکی کد مقصد نیست و یا (2) امکان نسخه‌برداری از کد منبع مرتبط روی یک سرویس‌دهنده‌ی شبکه بدون دریافت هیچ هزینه‌ای ارایه کنید.

 

ج) نسخه‌های جداگانه‌ای از کد مقصد را به همراه پیشنهاد کتبی برای رساندن کد منبع مرتبط ارایه کنید. این شیوه فقط در شرایط خاصی که شما کد منبع را مطابق با قوانین قسمت ب از بخش 6 این پروانه دریافت کرده باشید معتبر است.

 

د) کد مقصد را با پیشنهادی برای دسترسی از مکان مشخصی (به رایگان و یا با دریافت هزینه‌ای) برسانید و دسترسی مشابهی را برای رساندن کد منبع مرتبط از همان نقطه و بدون دریافت هزینه‌ای پیشنهاد دهید. شما گیرندگان را مجبور به دریافت کد منبع مرتبط به همراه کد مقصد نمی‌کنید. اگر مکان نسخه‌برداری از کد مقصد یک سرویس‌دهنده‌ی شبکه است کد منبع مرتبط می‌تواند روی سرویس‌دهنده‌ی دیگری باشد (که توسط شما و یا ارایه‌کننده‌ی ثالثی اداره می‌شود) که امکانات نسخه‌برداری مشابهی ارایه می‌کند به شرطی که شما در کنار کد مقصد توضیحات روشنی برای دریافت کد منبع ارایه کنید.

جدای از اینکه چه سرویس‌دهنده‌‌ای کد منبع مرتبط را پیشنهاد می‌دهد شما موظفید اطمینان حاصل نمایید کد منبع مرتبط تا زمان لازم در دسترس باشد تا با قوانین این پروانه سازگاری داشته باشید.

 

ه) کد مقصد را از طریق شبکه‌های نقطه به نقطه به دیگران برسانید به شرطی که به دیگر نقاط دریافت کننده اعلام کنید که کد منبع مرتبط با کار بدون دریافت هیچ هزینه‌ای و در تطابق با قسمت د بخش 6 این پروانه در اختیار عموم می‌باشد.

 

در رساندن کد مقصد به دیگران نیازی به رساندن یک قسمت مجزا از کد مقصد که کد منبع آن به عنوان کتابخانه‌ی سیستمی جدای از کد منبع مرتبط می‌باشد نیست.

 

یک «محصول شخصی» محصولی است که (1) «محصول مصرف‌کننده» باشد، به این معنی که به طور محسوس یک دارایی شخصی باشد که به طور متعارف برای مصارف شخصی، خانوادگی و یا استفاده در منزل کاربرد داشته باشد و یا (2) هر چیزی که برای تعبیه در محیط مسکونی طراحی یا فروخته شود. در مواردی که شکی در تشخیص اینکه یک محصول شخصی است یا خیر وجود دارد تردید باید به نفع پوشش کاربردی حل و فصل گردد. برای یک محصول خاص که توسط یک کاربر خاص دریافت شده‌است «استفاده‌ی متعارف» بدون توجه به کاربردهای خاصی که یک کاربر ممکن است داشته باشد و یا از محصول متوقع باشد به استفاده‌ی معمول یا عمومی از آن خانواده از محصول اطلاق می‌گردد. یک محصول شخصی است بدون توجه به اینکه ممکن است آن محصول تعداد قابل توجهی کاربردهای تجاری، صنعتی و با غیر شخصی داشته باشد مگر اینکه این کاربردها نشاندهنده‌ی تنها کارکرد اساسیِ آن محصول باشند.

 

«اطلاعات نصب» برای یک محصول شخصی  به معنی هر روش، ساز و کار، کلیدهای شناسایی یا دیگر اطلاعات لازم برای نصب و اجرای نسخه‌های تغییر یافته‌ی یک کار مشمول این پروانه می‌باشد که در آن محصول شخصی از کد تغییر یافته‌ی مرتبط بوجود آمده‌اند. این اطلاعات باید بقدری باشد که استفاده از کد مقصد بدون توجه به تغییرات ایجاد شده در کار همچنان قابل استفاده بوده و تداخلی در کارکرد و استفاده از آن ایجاد نکند.

 

اگر شما کد مقصد یک کار را بنا به قوانین این بخش برای استفاده اختصاصی یا غیر اختصاصی در یک محصول شخصی به دیگران می‌رسانید که در آن حق مالکیت و استفاده از محصول شخصی برای همیشه یا مدت مشخصی به کاربر انتقال می‌یابد (جدای از اینکه مشخصات این انتقال چست) کد منبع مرتبط می‌بایست بنا بر قوانین این بخش به همراه اطلاعات نصب در اختیار کاربر قرار گیرد. در صورتی که نه شما نه یک شخص ثالث امکان نصب کد تغییر یافته روی محصول شخصی را ندارید (برای مثال کار روی یک حافظه‌ی دایمی ROM از پیش نصب شده‌است) لزومی به ارایه کد منبع نیست.

 

نیاز به ارایه اطلاعات نصب شامل نیازی به ارایه خدمات پشتیبانی، ضمانت و یا به‌روزرسانی‌ کار ی که تغییر یافته و یا توسط دریافت کننده نصب شده است و یا روی محصول شخصی استفاده شده است را اجبار نمی‌کند.

امکان قطع دسترسی به یک شبکه در شرایطی که تغییرات تاثیر مخرب روی شبکه دارند و یا مخالف با قوانین و پروتکلهای ارتباط‌گیری روی شبکه هستند مجاز است.

 

رساندن کد منبع مرتبط و ارایه اطلاعات نصب که می‌بایست سازگار با قوانین این بخش انجام شود باید در قالبی باشد که به طور عمومی مستند گردیده (و یک پیاده‌سازی عمومی به صورت کد منبع از آن وجود دارد) و نمی‌بایست به هیچ کلمه‌ی عبور یا کلید برای خارج کردن از حالت فشرده، بسته بندی، نسخه‌برداری و یا خواندن نیاز داشته باشد.

 

7. قوانین افزوده شده

 

«قوانین افزوده شده» قوانینی هستند که اضافه بر مقررات این پروانه ارایه می‌شوند و حاوی استثنا در مورد یک یا چند قسمت این پروانه می‌باشند. قوانین افزودنی که برای یک برنامه‌ی کامل لحاظ می‌گردند به‌مانند قوانین این پروانه اعتبار دارند، به گونه‌ای که از سندیت قانونی همین پروانه برخورداند. اگر قوانین افزودنی فقط برای قسمتی از یک برنامه لحاظ گردند می‌توان به طور جداگانه از آن قسمت تحت آن قوانین استفاده نمود ولی کل برنامه تحت این پروانه باقی و بدون توجه به قوانین افزوده‌شده‌ي لحاظ شده قابل استفاده می‌باشد.

 

وقتی نسخه‌ای از یک برنامه‌ی شامل این پروانه را به دیگران می‌رسانید می‌توانید به انتخاب خود هریک از قوانین اضافی آن نسخه و یا قسمتهایی از آن نسخه که شامل قوانین افزوده‌شده می‌باشند را حذف نمایید. (ممکن است قوانین افزوده‌شده به‌گونه‌ای تنظیم شده باشند که شما را موظف به حذف آنها هنگام ایجاد هرگونه تغییر در کار بکند.) شما می‌توانید قوانین افزوده‌شده را به قسمتی از کار که خود شما به آن افزوده‌اید و صاحب اختیار حق‌تالیف آن قسمتها هستید اضافه کنید.

 

در صورت وجود نداشتن تضاد با دیگر قسمتهای این پروانه، برای کارهایی که شما به یک کار مشمول این پروانه اضافه کرده‌اید (در صورتی که صاحبین اختیار حق‌التالیف آن کار شما را مجاز شمرده باشند) می‌توانید قوانین افزودنی را به کار اضافه کنید به شرطی که مقررات زیر را رعایت نمایید:

 

الف) سلب مسوولیت از ضمانت یا محدود بودن مسوولیتها را متفاوت با آنچه در قسمتهای 15 و 16 این پروانه آمده است تعریف نمایید؛ یا

 

ب) نمایش اعلانهای قانونی متعارف و مرتبط و یا نمایش نشانهای مولف در کار یا در اعلانهایِ قانونیِ کارهایی دیگری که درون کار اصلی وجود دارند را اجباری نمایید؛ یا

 

ج) از ارایه نادرست اطلاعات درباره‌ی مبدا کار جلوگیری نمایید یا الزام کنید که تمام نسخه‌های تغییر یافته به گونه‌ای قابل قبول به عنوان نسخه‌های تغییر یافته نشانه‌گذاری گردند؛ یا

 

د) استفاده تبلیغاتی از اسامی صاحبان پروانه و یا مولفین کار را محدود نمایید؛ یا

 

ه) تمایل خود برای اعطای حقوق مالکیت نام‌های تجاری ثبت شده، نام‌های تجاری یا نام‌ خدمات شناخته شده را اعلام کنید؛ یا

 

و) با افزودن پیش‌فرض‌هایی درباره‌ي مسوولیت گیرنده به پروانه، در جاهایی که این پیش‌فرض‌ها به طور مستقیم به مولفین یا صاحبان پروانه‌ی کار بر‌می‌گردند، جبران خسارت صاحبان پروانه و مولفین را توسط هر کسی که کار (یا نسخه‌ی تغییر یافته‌ی آن را) می‌رساند اجباری نمایید.

 

تمام بندهای افزودنیِ غیرمجاز به عنوان «محدودیتهای بیشتر» که در قسمت 10 تعریف شده‌اند شناخته می‌شوند. اگر برنامه یا هر قسمتی از آن، آن‌گونه که شما آن را دریافت کرده‌اید، مشخص می‌سازد که شامل این پروانه و قوانین افزوده‌شده‌‌ی است که جزو «محدودیت‌های بیشتر» شناخته می‌شوند شما می‌توانید آن محدودیت را حذف نمایید. اگر سند پروانه‌ی یک برنامه شامل «محدودیتهای بیشتر» می‌باشد ولی اجازه صدور پروانه‌ی مجدد و رساندن کار تحت قوانین این پروانه را ارایه کرده است شما می‌توانید کارهایی به آن پروانه اضافه نمایید به شرطی که «محدودیتهای بیشتر» پروانه‌ی اولیه برای صدور پروانه‌ی جدید یا رساندن کار به دیگران محدودیت ایجاد نکنند.

 

اگر شما قوانینی را مطابق با دستورالعمل‌های این بخش به یک کار مشمول این پروانه می‌افزایید باید در مکان مناسب در کد منبع قوانین افزوده‌شده‌یِ حاکم بر آن کد و یا مکان دقیق یافتن قوانین اضافی مرتبط را مشخص نمایید.

 

قوانین افزوده‌شده، چه مجاز و چه «محدودیتهای بیشتر» می‌توانند به صورت یک پروانه‌ی جدا نگاشته شده و یا به عنوان موارد استثنا بر این پروانه ارایه گردند؛ در هر صورت رعایت الزامات ارایه شده در بالا اجباری است.

 

8. فسخ

 

شما نمی‌توانید تغییری در کار مشمول این پروانه ایجاد کرده و یا آن را انتشار دهید مگر اینکه قوانین این پروانه را به طور دقیق رعایت نمایید. هر عمل دیگری به جز آنچه منطبق بر این پروانه است غیرقانونی است و به طور خودکار تمام حقوقی که بنا به این پروانه در اختیار شما بوده است را  سلب می‌نماید (این حقوق شامل حقوق ثبت قانونی که در پاراگراف سوم قسمت 11 این پروانه قید شده است نیز می‌شود).

 

در هر صورت، اگر تمام حقوق شما بنا بر این پروانه لغو گردند پروانه‌ی شما از طرف یک صاحب پروانه دوباره معتبر خواهد بود (الف) اعتبار آزمایشی خواهد داشت، تا وقتی که صاحب پروانه به طور خاص و نهایی پروانه‌ی شما را ملغی نماید و (ب) اعتبار دایمی مجدد خواهد داشت، اگر صاحب پروانه ظرف مدت 60 روز از لغو اولیه  به معنای متعارفی شما را از لغو دایمی پروانه آگاه ننماید.

 

همچنین اگر صاحب یک پروانه به روش متعارفی شما را از خطای خود آگاه کند و این اولین باری باشد که شما از آن صاحب پروانه (برای تمامی کارهای آن صاحب پروانه)  چنین اخطاری دریافت می‌کنید و شما خطای خود را در کمتر از 30 روز از دریافت اخطار اصلاح نمایید پروانه‌ی شما دوباره اعتبار دایمی خواهد داشت.

 

لغو حقوق شما بنا به مقررات این قسمت باعث لغو پروانه‌ی دیگر افرادی که نسخه‌ها و یا حقوقی قانونی بر اساس این پروانه را از شما دریافت کرده‌اند نمی‌شود. اگر پروانه‌ی شما باطل گردیده و اعتبار مجدد دایمی ندارد شما صلاحیت دریافت پروانه‌ی جدید برای همان کار را بنا به مقررات قسمت 10 ندارید.

 

9. عدم لزوم پذیرفتن پروانه برای داشتن نسخه‌هایی از کار

 

برای دریافت نسخه‌ای از برنامه و یا اجرای آن لازم نیست این پروانه را بپذیرید. دریافت غیر مستقیم یک کارِ شامل این پروانه به عنوان نتیجه‌ی استفاده از انتقال روی بستر یک شبکه‌ی نقطه به نقطه نیز شما را ملزم به پذیرفتن این پروانه نمی‌سازد، اما هیچ چیزی به جز این پروانه به شما اجازه‌ی توزیع یا تغییر کارهای مشمول این پروانه را نمی‌دهد و اگر این پروانه را قبول ندارید این اعمال برخلاف قانون حقوق‌‌مولف است  و در نتیجه با تغییر یا توزیع یک کار مشمول این پروانه شما نشان می‌دهید که این پروانه را قبول کرده‌اید.

 

10. مشمولیت خودکار دریافت‌کنندگان پایین‌دستی به پروانه

 

هردفعه که شما یک کار مشمول این پروانه را به دیگران می‌رسانید، دریافت کننده به طور خودکار از صاحبان پروانه حق اجرا، تغییر و توزیع کار را بنا بر این پروانه دریافت می‌کند. شما مسوول اجبار دیگران به رعایت قوانین این پروانه نیستید.

 

یک «تراکنش نهادی» تراکنشی است که کنترل یک سازمان یا تمام دارایی‌های آن را به دیگری انتقال می‌دهد و یا با دیگری تقسیم می‌نماید یا آنها را ترکیب می‌کند. اگر توزیع یک کار در نتیجه‌ی یک تراکنش نهادی انجام شود، هر طرفِ تراکنش که یک نسخه از کار را دریات می‌کند یک نسخه از همه‌ی پروانه‌های همراه کار را که طرف دیگر پیشتر داشته و یا می‌تواند اعطا کند دریافت می‌نماید و همچنین در صورتی که طرف پیشین به کد منبع دسترسی داشته و یا از امکان متعارفی برای دستیابی به آن برخوردار است، حق دریافت کد منبع مرتبط را از صاحب پیشین خواهد داشت.

 

شما نمی‌توانید محدودیتهای بیشتری  بر روی حقوقی که بنا به این پروانه ارایه یا حفظ شده است لحاظ نمایید. برای مثال شما نمی‌توانید درخواست هزینه‌ی صدور پروانه یا حق‌تالیف و یا موارد مشابه را بنمایید و شما نمی‌توانید مدعی یک دعوای حقوقی باشید (نه ادعای خودی و نه ادعای عمومی در یک شکایت قضایی) که در آن به تجاوز به قوانین ثبتی و حقوق‌‌امتیاز دیگران بخاطر تولید، استفاده، فروش، پیشنهاد فروش و یا واردات برنامه یا هر قسمتی از آن اعتراض شود.

 

11. قوانین ثبتی و حقوق‌امتیاز

 

یک «مشارکت‌کننده» صاحب حق‌امتیازی است که اجازه استفاده از برنامه یا کاری که بنا بر برنامه تهیه شده است را بر اساس پروانه می‌دهد. این کار که حقوق آن بنا به پروانه محافظت شده است به عنوان «نسخه‌ی مشارکت‌کننده» شناخته می‌شود.

«حقوق ثبتی پایه»‌ی یک مشارکت‌کننده تمامی ادعاهای مالکیت ثبتیِ در اختیارِ مشارکت کننده می‌باشند که تا کنون به ثبت رسیده‌اند یا به ثبت خواهند رسید و با تولید، استفاده و یا فروش نسخه‌ی مشارکت کننده به آنها تجاوز می‌شود ولی در صورت ایجاد تغییرات در نسخه‌ی مشارکت‌کننده شامل ادعای تجاوز به حقوق مشارکت‌کننده نخواهد شد. در این تعریف «کنترل» به معنی اجازه‌ی صدور زیرپروانه‌هایِ ثبتی است که با دستورالعملهای این پروانه هماهنگی داشته باشند.

 

هر مشارکت‌کننده به شما یک پروانه‌ی غیرانحصاری، بین‌المللی و بدون‌هزینه‌یِ حق‌مالکیت بر اساس حقوق ثبتی پایه‌ی خود می‌دهد تا تولید، استفاده، فروش، پیشنهاد فروش، واردات ویا اجرا، تغییر و توزیع محتویات نسخه‌ی مشارکت‌کننده قانونی و حقوقی باشند.

 

در سه پاراگراف بعدی، «حق امتیاز» هر قرارداد یا تعهد واضحی در این زمینه است اما نام‌گذاری مجزا شده‌است تا یک ثبت تجاری را اجبار نکند (برای نمونه یک اجازه واضح برای اجبار ثبت تجاری و یا پیمانی برای شمایت نکردن علیه حقوق ثبت‌شده‌ی تجاری). برای «واگذاری» چنین پروانه‌ی حق امتیازی به یک شخص به معنی انعقاد چنین قرارداد یا تعهدی است تا هیچ حق‌ثبتی علیه او بکار گرفته نشود.

 

اگر شما کاری‌که مشمول پروانه است را به دیگران می‌رسانید که آگاهید بر اساس یک پروانه‌ی حق امتیاز ارایه شده است و کد منبع مرتبطِ کار برای نسخه‌برداری به رایگان و تحت شرایط این پروانه و از طریق سرویس‌دهنده‌های شبکه و یا دیگر راههای متعارف و دردسترس در اختیار دیگران نمی‌باشد باید (1) باعث ارایه کدِ منبع مرتبط با شرایطی که نام‌برده شد شوید یا (2) برای محروم کردن یا صرف نظر کردن خود از منافع حق‌امتیاز آن کار خاص اقدام نمایید یا (3) اقدامی متناسب با شرایط این پروانه مبنی بر توسعه‌ی حق‌امتیاز و انتقال آن به دریافت کنندگان پایین دستی شوید.

 

«آگاهی از ارایه تحت قوانین حق‌امتیاز» به معنی آگاهی شما از ارایه کار تحت این شرایط است اما برای پروانه‌ی حق‌امتیاز رساندن یک کار مشمول این پروانه در یک کشور و یا استفاده گیرنده از کار در یک کشور که شما دلایل قابل قبولی مبنی بر زیر پا گذاشتن حقوق مالکیت در آن کشور در صورت استفاده از کار در آنجا دارید کافی هستند.

اگر متعاقب یا در ارتباط با یک تراکنش یا قرارداد شما کاری را به دیگران برسانید و یا توزیع کنید و به بعضی از دریافت کنندگانِ کارِ مشمول این پروانه مجوز استفاده، توزیع، تغییر یا رساندن یک نسخه‌ی خاص از کارِ مشمول پروانه‌ی حق‌امتیاز را بدهید آنگاه پروانه‌ی حق‌امتیازِ صادر شده از طرف شما به طور خودکار برای تمامی دریافت کنندگان آن کار و کارهای مبتنی بر آن کار معتبر می‌باشند.

 

یک پروانه‌ی حق‌امتیاز «تبعیض آمیز» است اگر در محدوده‌ی تحت پوشش خود پیروی از یک یا چند قانون از این پروانه را محدود یا ممنوع نماید. شما نباید یک کار مشمول این پروانه را به دیگران برسانید اگر طرف قراردادی با یک شخص ثالث هستید که در کسب و کار توزیع نرم‌افزار است و بنا به آن قرارداد شما به آن شخص ثالث مبلغی بابت فعالیت خود در محدوده‌ی رساندن کار به دیگران می‌پردازید و بر همین اساس او به تمام افرادی که کار را از شما دریافت کرده‌اند یک پروانه‌ی حق امتیازِ تبعیض آمیز ارایه می‌کند (الف) در ارتباط با کار مشمول پروانه که توسط شما رسانده‌شده است (یا نسخه‌هایی که از روی نسخه‌های شما تهیه شده‌اند) یا (ب) به طور اختصاصی برای و در ارتباط با محصولات مشخص شده که حاوی کارِ مشمول پروانه می‌گردنند، مگر اینکه شما وارد آن قرارداد شده باشید یا پروانه‌ی حق‌امتیاز تا قبل از هشتم فروردین ماه هزار و سیصد و هشتاد و شش صادر شده باشند.

 

هیچ بخشی از این پروانه نباید به عنوان محدودکننده یا مستثنی‌کننده‌ی هر پروانه یا دفاعی که تجاوز به حقوق‌امتیازی بوده که بصورت قانونی در اختیار شما بوده است استفاده شود.

 

12. عدم تسلیم آزادی دیگران

 

اگر شرایط به گونه‌ای به شما تحمیل شده‌اند (چه توسط دادگاه، قرارداد و یا نحو دیگری) که با مقررات این پروانه در تضاد هستند، این شرایط نمی‌توانند دلیلی برای سرپیچی شما از قوانین این پروانه محسوب گردند. اگر شما نمی‌توانید یک کار مشمول این پروانه را به گونه‌ای به دیگران برسانید که بطور همزمان شرایط این پروانه و دیگر شرایط تحمیلی به خودتان را حفظ نمایید امکان رساندن و ارایه را نخواهید داشت. به عنوان نمونه، اگر شما با شرایطی توافق کنید که شما را وادار به دریافت حق‌التالیف برای کارهایی که ازاین پس به دیگران می‌رسانید بنماید تنها راهی که می‌توانید با آن شرایط و شرایط این پروانه سازگاری را حفظ کنید خودداری کامل از ارایه برنامه است.

 

13. استفاده به همراه پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی افرویِ گنو

 

پروانه‌ی افرو تضادی با هیچ‌یک از قسمتهای این پروانه ندارد، شما مجازید تا هر کار تحت پوشش این پروانه را با کاری که تحت نسخه‌ی سومِ پروانه‌ی افرویِ گنو ارایه شده است ترکیب و یا لینک نمایید و کار حاصل را به دیگرن برسانید. قوانین این پروانه همچنان برای آن قسمت از کار نهایی که از ابتدا تحت این پروانه بوده‌ است معتبر خواهد بود ولی نیازهای خاص قسمت 13 پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی افرویِ گنو که بر ارتباطات تحت شبکه نظارت می‌کند برای کل کار نهایی معتبر خواهد بود.

 

14. نگارش‌‌های بازنویسی شده‌ی این پروانه

 

ممکن است هر از چند گاهی بنیاد نرم‌افزارهای آزاد نگارش‌‌های جدید پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو را منتشر نماید. این نگارش‌های جدید از نظر محتوی و مفهوم با این نسخه یکی خواهند بود ولی ممکن است در جزییات تفاوتهایی داشته باشند و یا پاسخی برای مشکلات و مسایل جدید داشته باشند.

 

هر نگارش با یک شماره نگارش مجزا شناخته می‌شود. اگر برنامه به طور خاص مشخص نماید که مشمول یک نگارش خاص یا «تمامی نگارش‌های پس از آن» می‌باشد شما می‌توانید بر اساس قوانین آن نگارش خاص یا نگارشهای پس از آن که توسط بنیاد نرم‌افزارهای آزاد منتشر شده اند عمل کنید. اگر برنامه به یک نگارش خاص از پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو اشاره نکند شما می‌توانید هر نگارشی از پروانه را که تا کنون توسط بنیاد نرم‌افزارهای آزاد منتشر شده برگزینید.

 

اگر برنامه مشخص نماید که یک داور حق تعیین نگارش مورد استفاده‌ی پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی برای برنامه را دارد، اعلان عمومی آن داور برای همیشه معیار انتخاب نگارش مورد استفاده برای آن برنامه می‌گردد.

 

نگارشهای آتی ممکن است حقوق اضافی یا متفاوتی را در اختیار شما بگذارند ولی در صورت انتخاب شما برای استفاده از نگارش جدید‌تر هیچ اجبار اضافی برای هیچ مولف یا صاحب پروانه‌ای ایجاد نمی‌شود.

 

15. بدون ضمانت

 

تا آنجا که قوانین جاری موجودند هیچ ضمانتی برای برنامه وجود ندارد مگر اینکه خلاف این امر به صورت مکتوب ارایه شده باشد در غیر اینصورت صاحبان حق‌تالیف و یا دیگران برنامه را «همان طور که هست» و بدون هیچ‌گونه ضمانتی، نه ضمانت مشخص و نه ضمانتی که ممکن است کاربر توقع داشته باشد، ارایه می‌کنند. این عدم ضمانت شامل ضمانت قابل ارایه تجاری بودنِ کار و یا صلاحیت کار برای یک کاربرد خاص و یا دیگر موارد می‌باشد. تمام مخاطرات کیفیت و کارآیی برنامه مرتبط با شماست. اگر مشخص گردید که برنامه مشکل‌دار است، شما تمام هزینه‌های رفع ایرادات اختمالی و یا تعمیر یا سرویس احتمالی را تقبل خواهید کرد.

 

16. محدودیت مسوولیت

تحت هیچ شرایطی، مگر وقتی که قانونی مقرر کرده باشد و یا بر اساس مجوزِ مکتوب صاحب امتیاز یا هر توزیع‌کننده‌ی ثالث که برنامه را تغییر داده و یا توزیع می‌کند، هیچ مسوولیتی در قبال هر خسارتی از جمله خسارات کلی، خاص، واقعه و یا پی‌آمدهای استفاده و یا عدم امکان استفاده از برنامه (از جمله از دست رفتن اطلاعات، تولید اطلاعات غلط و یا ضررهایی برای شما و یا اشخاص ثالث و یا عدم کارآیی برنامه در کارکردن با دیگر برنامه‌ها) را  ندارند، حتی اگر آنها به احتمال وقوع این خسارات اشاره کرده باشند.

 

17.تفسیر قسمتهای 15 و 16

 

اگر عدم ضمانت و محدودیت مسوولیت که در بالا توضیح داده‌شدند به خاطر مقررات قید شده نمی‌توانند به عنوان بندهای قانونی استناد شوند، دادگاههای بررسی کننده باید نزدیک‌ترین قانون محلی که تمامی حقوق مدنیِ در ارتباط با برنامه را از صاحب پروانه سلب می‌کنند در نظر بگیرند مگر اینکه یک ضمانتنامه و یا قرارداد بر عهده‌گرفتن مسوولیت به همراه برنامه در قبال پرداخت هزینه‌ای برای ارایه‌ی این خدمات دریافت شده‌باشد.

 

پایان قوانین و مقررات

 

چگونگی پیاده‌سازی این قوانین و مقررات در برنامه‌ی خود

 

اگر شما برنامه جدیدی نوشته‌اید و می خواهید همگان حداکثر بهره را از آن ببرند بهترین راه تبدیل آن به یک برنامه آزاد است که هرکسی می تواند مطابق مقرراتی که در بالا آمده آن را به دیگران برساند و یا تغییر دهد.

 

برای انجام این کار این توضیحات را به برنامه اضافه نمایید، بسیار امن‌تر است تا آنها را به ابتدای هر یک از کدهای اصلی اضافه کنید، به خصوص برای نمایش اعلان عدم وجود ضمانت و همچنین پروانه حق تالیف و اینکه کل آن را در کجا باید یافت.

اگر برنامه با کاربر تعامل دارد خروجی آن را طوری طراحی کنید که اعلان کوتاهی را، وقتی که بصورت تعاملی اجرا می شود، نمایش دهد:

 

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

 

دستورات فرضیِ ‘show w’ و ‘show c’ باید قسمتهای مناسب از پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی درباره‌ی حق‌تالیف و ضمانت برنامه را نمایش دهند، شکی نیست امکان دارد دستورات برنامه‌‌ی شما متفاوت باشند، به احتمال زیاد برای یک رابط کاربر گرافیکی از یک ‘about box’ استفاده خواهید کرد.

 

در ضمن اگر لازم است می بایست از کارفرما (در صورتی که به عنوان برنامه‌نویس استخدام هستید) و یا مدرسه یا دانشگاه خود (در صورتی که با آنها کار می کنید) بخواهید یک برگه‌ی سلب مسوولیت حقوق مولف را برای برنامه امضا نمایند. برای اطلاعات بیشتر در این مورد و یا در مورد روش استفاده از پروانه‌ی جامع همگانی گنو در برنامه‌های خود آدرس <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>  را مرور نمایید.

 

این پروانه به شما اجازه نمی‌دهد تا برنامه خود را با برنامه‌های انحصاری ترکیب نمایید، اگر برنامه‌ی شما یک کتابخانه‌ی توابع است ممکن است قابلیت استفاده برنامه‌های انحصاری از برنامه خود را مفید ببینید؛ در این صورت از «پروانه‌ی کمترْ جامعِ همگانی گنو» یا GNU Lesser General Public License  به جای این پروانه استفاده کنید ولی قبل از آن حتماً اطلاعات موجود در <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>. زا مرور کنید.
